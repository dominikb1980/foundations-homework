CADILLAC CTS 3.6  2008        WHEN I GET ON IT A LITTLE BIT ACCELERATION IT MAKES A SOUND THAT SOUNDS LIKE ALL AIR LEAKS INSIDE THE CAR. THE DEALER WAS REPORTED EVER SINCE MY FIRST EARLY VISIT TO SERVICE CENTER BUT IT'S ONLY DURING MY LAST VISIT TO THE DEALER THEY MENTIONED GM HAS SANCTIONED APPROVAL IE.  AT THE TIME THE ODOMETER READS 65000KM? STRANGE!  THE DOOR LOCKS ARE TERRIBLE?DESPITE RECTIFYING; TIME AND AGAIN BY YOUR DEALER THE PROBLEM STILL PERSIST TO DATE.  SAFETY HAZARD INDEED.   THE COMPUTER HAD ERROR AS FOR TYRE  LOW AIR PRESSURE   VERY BAD ON SAFETY STANDARDS.  ON 12TH AUG  2012  WHILE I WAS EN-ROUTE TO THE CADILLAC SERVICE CENTER  THE VEHICLE HAD A BREAK DOWN. ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN NEAR ODOMETER IT DISPLAYED ENGINE TEMPERATURE TOO HIGH ?.  DUE TO THIS I HAD TO PULL THE CAR TOWARDS SAFETY AND GOT STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD UNDER THE HOT SUN.  HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY A CAR WHICH IS REGULARLY MAINTAINED BY YOUR AUTHORIZED AGENCY AT REGULAR PERIODIC INTERVALS TO HAVE SUCH A FATE?     I FELT IT WAS GOOD TO HAVE IT SERVICED DURING MY ABSENCE IN TOWN BEFORE THE REGULAR KM INTERVAL; BUT, ONLY TO GET STRANDED ON THE ROAD IN THE HOT SUN. IT IS INDEED, TOO MUCH TO SUFFER AFTER BUYING A CAR OF GM FLAGSHIP BRAND < CADILLAC > AND SUFFER AGONY ON THE ROAD SIDE.  NOT TO MENTION THE DEALERSHIPS WARRANTY YOU PROVIDE WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE NEW CAR FROM YOUR AUTHORIZED AGENTS, PROBABLY DON'T FIX ANYTHING WITH THE WARRANTY SERVICE PROGRAM. IF THE JOB WAS RIGHT THEN THE ENGINE SHOULD NOT HAVE OVER HEATED ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CAR IS JUST RUN 71000 KMS. APPROX...  *TR"

MY LEG WAS ALSO IN THE BREAK PEDAL AS I MADE THOSE TURNS AFTER GETTING INTO THE PRIVATE PROPERTY FROM IL RTE 83. I CAN DEFINITELY CONFIRM THAT MY LEG WAS NOT IN GAS PEDAL AS MY RIGHT LEG WAS ON THE BREAK PEDAL TO MAKE THOSE TURNS AND STOP THE CAR IN THE PARKING SPACE. IT ALL HAPPENED IN THE MATTER OF FEW SECONDS AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACT. THE CAR CAME TO HALT ONLY AFTER HITTING THE BUILDING. BOTH AIR BAGS DEPLOYED AS SOON AS THE CAR HIT THE BUILDING AND THERE WAS HEAVE SMOKE INSIDE THE CAR. IT WAS REALLY SCARY BECAUSE BY LOOKING AT THE DAMAGE THE SPEED AT THE TIME OF ACCIDENT LOOKS TO BE AROUND 50 MPH. IT WAS A RELATIVELY HIGHER CURB IN FRONT AND THE BUILDING WAS JUST 6 - 8 FEET AWAY FROM THE CURB, I WAS ALSO DRIVING INTO THE PARKING SPACE AT LESS THAN 10 MPH. I AM REALLY SHOCKED TO SEE THIS KIND OF UNINTENDED/SUDDEN ACCELERATION HAPPEN WITH HONDA ACCORD CARS WHICH COULD PROVE TO BE FATAL FOR THE DRIVER, PASSENGER AND PEDESTRIAN ALIKE.  *TR"

I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP AND FOUND THAT MY DASH WAS SO BAD IT HAD TO BE REPLACED. MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AT THIS TIME ALSO. NOW MY DASH IS COMMING UP JUST LIKE IT DID BEFORE, EVIDENTLY THE DASH THEY REPLACED IT WITH STILL HAD THE DEFECTIVE GLUE IN IT. I CONTACTED FORD EXPLAINING THIS TO THEM AND FINDING OUT THAT THE MAINTENANCE ORDER HAD ENDED LAST YEAR. I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT BEING REPLACED AND DOING THE SAME THING IT DONE BEFORE WHILE ALSO EXPLAINING MY CONCERN ABOUT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG RELEASING AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

THEY REFUSE TO REPAIR MY DASH EVEN THOUGH I DID WHAT THE LETTER TOLD ME AND COULDN'T HAVE AVOIDED THIS PROBLEM FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

,"THE INCIDENT OCCURRED JUST AFTER MERGING ONTO THE INNER-LOOP 495 NORTH-BOUND FROM WEST-BOUND HIGHWAY 50, BETWEEN HIGHWAY 50 AND 66, IN FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA. DURING THE MERGE, I ACCELERATED MY VEHICLE TO EQUAL TO THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC WHILE MAINTAINING MY POSITION IN THE ON/OFF-LANE USED FOR THE 50/60 MERGER. BECAUSE I WAS CONTINUING NORTH-BOUND ON 495 TOWARDS TYSON'S CORNER, I STARTED PROCEDURES TO EXIT THE 66 ON-LANE AND MERGE INTO NORTH-BOUND 495 TRAFFIC. THESE PROCEDURES INCLUDED CHECKING BOTH MY SIDE AND REAR-VIEW MIRRORS AS WELL AS MY BLIND SPOTS. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DURING THE PROCEDURES MY EYES WERE ROUTINELY FORWARD TO CHECK ON FORWARD TRAFFIC. BETWEEN MY MIRROR AND BLIND SPOT CHECKS, I NOTICED THAT I WAS QUICKLY APPROACHING A MASSIVE POTHOLE THAT LAID DIRECTLY IN THE PATH OF MY FORWARD PROGRESSION. I ESTIMATE THE POTHOLE SIZE BEING TWO FEET IN LENGTH, ONE FOOT IN WIDTH, AND ONE FOOT IN DEPTH (I HAVE PICTURES). ALTHOUGH I ATTEMPTED TO AVOID THE POTHOLE, AT AROUND 60MPH, IN THE RAIN, WITH A GUARD RAIL TO MY RIGHT AND TRAFFIC TO MY LEFT, THERE WAS VERY LITTLE I COULD DO TO AVOID IT WITHOUT RISKING MY LIFE, MY PASSENGER'S LIFE, AND LIVES OF FELLOW COMMUTERS. I HIT THE POTHOLE. THE IMPACT WAS SO SEVER IT NOT ONLY BENT MY FRONT, PASSENGER'S SIDE WHEEL AND RIPPED A QUARTER-SIZE GAPING HOLE IN MY TIRE, IT DEPLOYED ALL MY PASSENGER'S SIDE AIRBAGS AND POSSIBLY RUINED MY SUSPENSION. AT THE TIME OF IMPACT, MY PASSENGER WAS LEANING AGAINST THE ARM-RESTS AND THE WINDOW DIRECTLY ON THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT PATH. HIS ARM, FACE, AND HEARING WERE INJURED DURING THE INCIDENT. I ALLOWED THE CAR TO SLOW DOWN TO SAFE SPEEDS BY RELEASING THE ACCELERATOR. ONCE AT SAFE SPEEDS, I CONTINUED TO AN EMERGENCY EXIT PULLOUT WHERE I AWAITED POLICE AND A TOWING VEHICLE. AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE POLICE, A VDOT EMERGENCY VEHICLE PULLED UP AND OFFERED ASSISTANCE. HE LATER INFORMED ME THAT THE POTHOLE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADDRESSED AND SHOULD HAVE FIXED WELL BEFORE THE TIME OF MY INCIDENT. *TR"

THE COMPLAINT THOUGH, IS THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT, WHERE I WAS SITTING WITH MY SEAT BELT IN USE, DID NOT WITHSTAND THE COLLISION.  THE UPRIGHT PORTION OF THE SEAT WAS LAYING ON TOP OF THE BACK SEAT AFTER THE IMPACT.  THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACK AND SHOULDER INJURIES I RECEIVED.  THE TOYOTA WAS NOT HIT FROM THE SIDE SO THE FAILURE OF THE SEAT WAS NOT THE RESULT OF A DIRECT IMPACT. THE SEAT SIMPLY CAME LOOSE AND FAILED TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS I WAS THROWN FORWARD AND THEN BACK.    AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS, THE BODY SHOP CHECKED THE SEAT AND STATED THE LOCKING MECHANISM IS WORKING PROPERLY HOWEVER, THE SEAT HAS NOT BEEN ""RIGHT"" SINCE THE ACCIDENT.  IT IS NOT PROPERLY POSITIONED.   THE IMPACT WAS FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL (UP TO $5000 IN DAMAGE - TRUNK WAS CRUMPLED AND OTHER DAMAGE) AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  JUST AFTER THE MOMENT OF IMPACT, I LOOKED OVER AT MY MOTHER WHO WAS DRIVING AND WATCHED IN HORROR AS SHE SNAPPED OVER THE STEERING WHEEL. I DON'T KNOW IF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT REQUIRES A ""HEAD-ON"" BEFORE THE BAGS WILL DEPLOY BUT THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE (INITIALLY I WAS AFRAID MY MOTHER'S NECK HAD FRACTURED) AND HAD MY MOTHER GONE ANY FURTHER FORWARD, THE FAILURE OF THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS IF NOT FATAL INJURY.  *NM  "
